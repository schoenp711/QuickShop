# QuickShop

QuickShop is a shopping app that optimizes your grocery store experience. No need to wander through the store wondering where each item is. The QuickShop app displays a complete list of items from a store, tap on an item to add it to your shopping list. You can filter the list by tapping the search icon in the upper right hand corner. You can add/remove items as you please by pressing the back button on your Android device/swiping an item away. After you are happy with your shopping list you can continue through the app to the shopping section where an optimized list of the fastest way through the grocery store will be presented to you. Swipe away items as you go through the store.
